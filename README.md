SmaatoADSample [BlackBerry 10 Cascades]
==============

Sample project about how to integrate the Smaato Advertisement SDK into you BlackBerry 10 Cascades Projects!

Version 1.0:

This is the same project as BlackBerry published on their community-sample repository.
(https://github.com/blackberry/Cascades-Community-Samples/tree/master/SmaatoAdSDKSample)

I provided this sample for users who want to integrated the new Smaato AD SDK into their Cascades Apps!


Future work:

I'd like to add move configurations into the app, so deveelopers can test different publisherID and adSpaceID in the settings, rather than hard-code in the project and needs to re-build in order to make the change work!!


Any questions about this project, just let me know!
